This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Foundation with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

My team at [Dev Pipeline](https://devpipeline.com/) likes to use what we call a "Foundation" app to bootstrap new projects. It contains all the basic
functionality and UI necessary for just about any app we need, including a database, routing, authentication, and error handling. The original is built
with [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the frontend and Python with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) on the backend with a [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
database.
